# `git grab`

### What is `git grab`?

> Ever had this happen: you go to your own or someone else's repo, and see a part of that repo that you want?
> Well, `git grab` helps you get just that part of the repo, without having to clone the whole thing and
> copy the files over!

For example, while going through this repo, I find an exercise, like `instagram`, that I want to copy to
my own current repo.

First, I copy the link:

Then I go to the directory I want to copy it to:

And I use **`git grab`**, and paste in the copied URL!
